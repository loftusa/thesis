    "When we work with networks, we need a way to represent them mathematically and in our code. A network itself lives in network space, which is just the set of all possible networks. Network space is kind of abstract and inconvenient if we want to use traditional mathematics, so we'd generally like to represent networks with groups of numbers to make everything more concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we would often like to represent networks with *matrices*. In addition to being computationally convenient, using matrices to represent networks lets us bring in a surprising amount of tools from linear algebra and statistics. Programmatically, using matrices also lets us use common Python tools for array manipulation like numpy.\n",

    "The beating heart of matrix representations for networks throughout this book is the adjacency matrix. The idea is pretty straightforward: Let's say you have a network with $n$ nodes. You give each node an index -- usually some value between 0 and n -- and then you create an $n \\times n$ matrix. If there is an edge between node $i$ and node $j$, you fill the $(i, j)_{th}$ value of the matrix with an entry, usually $1$ if your network has unweighted edges. In the case of undirected networks, you end up with a symmetric matrix with full of 1's and 0's, which completely represents the topology of your network.\n",
