    "This thesis is essentially a general overview of spectral methods on networks, and how you can use tools from a network's eigenspace to understand and explain the network more deeply. Why are networks an interesting thing to learn about, and why should you care?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, at some level, every aspect of reality seems to be made of interconnected parts. Atoms and molecules are connected to each other with chemical bonds. Your neurons connect to each other through synapses, and the different parts of your brain connect to each other through groups of neurons interacting with each other. At a larger level, you are interconnected with other humans through social networks, and our economy is a global, interconnected trade network. The Earth's food chain is an ecological network, and larger still, every object with mass in the universe is connected to every other object through a gravitational network.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you can understand networks, you can understand a little something about everything!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover the fundamentals of spectral methods with respect to network data science, focusing on developing intuition on networks as statistical objects, while paired with relevant Python code. By the end of this thesis, you will be able to utilize efficient and easy to use tools available for performing analyses on networks. You will also have a whole new range of statistical techniques in your toolbox, such as representations, theory, and algorithms for networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll spend this thesis learning about network algorithms by showing how they're implemented in production-ready Python frameworks:\n",
    "- Numpy and Scipy are used for scientific programming. They give you access to array objects, which are the main way we'll represent networks computationally.\n",
    "- Scikit-Learn is very easy to use, yet it implements many Machine Learning algorithms efficiently, so it makes a great entry point for downstream analysis of networks.\n",
    "- Graspologic is an open-source Python package developed by Microsoft and the NeuroData lab at Johns Hopkins University which gives you utilities and algorithms for doing statistical analyses on network-valued data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thesis favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of networks through concrete working examples and a bit of theory. While you can read this thesis without picking up your laptop, I highly recommend you experiment with the code examples available online as Jupyter notebooks at [http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/index.html](http://docs.neurodata.io/graph-stats-book/index.html).\n",
