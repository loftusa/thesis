# ## Abstract

# This thesis is a general overview of spectral methods on networks, and how you can use tools from a network’s eigenspace to understand and explain the network more deeply.
# 
# Networks are some of the most fundamental building blocks of the universe. Atoms and molecules are connected to each other with chemical bonds. Neurons connect to each other through synapses, and the different parts of the brain connect to each other through groups of neurons interacting with each other. At a larger level, we are interconnected with other humans through social networks, and our economy is a global, interconnected trade network. The Earth’s food chain is an ecological network, and larger still, every object with mass in the universe is connected to every other object through a gravitational network.
# 
# This thesis covers the fundamentals of spectral methods with respect to network data science, focusing on developing intuition on networks as statistical objects, while paired with relevant Python code.

# I am grateful to my advisor, Joshua Vogelstein, for his insights and strong feedback. The value he puts on clarity and simplicity in any mathematical model has been an enormous help throughout this process.
# 
# I am also especially grateful to Eric Bridgeford, who has been giving me constant feedback throughout the writing process. I would be lost in a sea of papers without his help.
